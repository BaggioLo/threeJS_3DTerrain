these notes are for note taking during the tutorial

Your 3d objects is how you define the shape of it, in the object section
material is the skin of the object and the mesh is both of those things combined.

There is a plain geometry and a buffer geometry, we will be using a geometry
and creating it using the object to create the plane. The higher the numbers when 
creating the Three.PlaneBufferGeometry(3, 3, 64, 64) the higher the quality and smoother it will be.

A lot of work will go into the Materials section to add on the Objects to achieve the specific
effects we are looking for.

This Mesh will allow us to pass in the geometry and material
as arguments and put them together to create our object into view.

after we define the plane that meshes the geometry and material together,
we have to add the constant plane to the scene by scene.add(plane). That way we can actually view it.

The scene is the setting and we will be passing a lot of the objects onto the scene
so we are able to create the 3d object. One of those things we pass is also the camera
scene.add(camera) and that way we are able to view our object.

We will be rotating the plane on the x-axis to set the foundation of how we will be adding everything.
plane.rotation.x = 181;

To add the texture to the object, we have to load the texture first as an image file 
and then add it to MeshStandardMaterial with map: texture.

we added a clouds image created from photoshop to the map to give it a little bit more depth.
We did this with displacementMaps. The displacementScale will adjust how high or low the height is on the actual terrain itself.
There is a blinder effect that naturally happens because of its rendering. To remove that we will 
use depthTest and set it to false because it is defaulted to true.
